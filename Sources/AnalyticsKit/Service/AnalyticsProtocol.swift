     You must make sure that the Analytics instance is unique and is not overwritten during the application lifecycle.
     
     If the object is lost after the providers are registered, the `sendEvent` method will have no event dispatch targets.
     
     ### Example
     ```
     // TODO: Rewrite the example
     ```
     
     - Parameter provider: A wrapper over providers that allows you to select one of the predefined objects or add a new one.
