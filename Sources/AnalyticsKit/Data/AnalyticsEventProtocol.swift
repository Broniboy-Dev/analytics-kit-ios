     The event name is appended to the module name. In general, it will look like this:
     ```
     // .appear - this is the event case, returned - "Appear"
     // .auth - this is the module case, returned - "AuthScreen"
     
     // When this call is triggered, an event named "AuthScreenAppear"
     // will be dispatched.
     analytics.service.sendEvent(.appear, from: .auth)
     
     ```
